Task Description
Write a C++ commandline program, which reads names from either a text file or from user input. The program should be able to example an alphabetic score based on the entered names. Therefor it should sort the list into alphabetical order. Then work out the alphabetical value for each name and multiply this value by its position in the list to obtain a name score. For bad_example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So COLIN would obtain a score of 938 x 53 = 49714.

The following commands should be provided by the program:

read_file path_to_file: reads names from a text file. The format of the text files should correspond to the names.txt attached to this repo.
new_name NAME: allows the user to enter a name (duplicates are allowed)
print_list: prints the content of the list
compute_score: computes the alphabetic score for the list
quit: quits the application
Make sure the program

fulfills the requirements above,
is flexible and
can be extended well. (Assume that the program will be extended with further functions or scores in the future.)
In addition we value

readable and 'clean' code,
tests and
reasonable handling of git.
Conditions
You have 3 days to solve the task.

To process the task, you should create your own branch in the repository you can work on and from which we can extract the solution later on.

There are no restrictions regarding the platform or the compiler. We have added a CMake and boost::test based template but you can change it as you find suitable. Do not hesitate to change the complete project structure including removing boost::test.

We only ask you to not use any external libraries except for testing purposes and keep your project ctest-able. Please stick to the standard library.

Example:
// Starting the program

> ./names_score

Enter command: new_name Anton

Enter command: new_name Alex

Enter command: print_list

Anton

Alex

Enter command: compute_score
